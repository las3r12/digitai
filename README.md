# Handwritten Digit Generator (MNIST)

This project is a web application that uses a **locally trained AI model on the MNIST dataset** to generate an image of a handwritten digit based on a user-provided number.

The model learns the visual style of handwritten digits and produces a synthetic image corresponding to the requested digit (0–9).

## Features

- Generate handwritten digit images (0–9)
- Uses a **local AI model** trained on the MNIST dataset
- Simple web interface
- Fast inference without external APIs
- Fully offline (after setup)

---

## How It Works

1. The user enters a digit (0–9) in the web interface
2. The backend sends the digit to the local AI model
3. The model generates a handwritten-style image
4. The generated image is returned and displayed in the browser

## Model

- **Dataset:** MNIST
- **Task:** Image generation of handwritten digits
- **Training:** Local training (no cloud dependencies)
- **Output:** Grayscale image representing the requested digit

## Usage

1. Open the website in your browser
2. Enter a number to generate and a number of images you want to get
3. Click **Generate**
4. View the generated handwritten digit image
